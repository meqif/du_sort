du_sort: a short script for sorting 'du' output correctly

Don't you hate when you want to quickly check what's using the most space in
your laptop's disk or server's RAID but 'du -hsc *' gives you unsorted output?

Using 'du -hsc * | sort --numeric-sort' doesn't help because the units after the
size mess everything up and using 'du -k' to display the size in blocks would
allow easy sorting but defeat the purpose of having human-readable units.

So I did what any respectable programmer would do: create a script that would
sort the results exactly as I want them. That's how this script was born.

I hope it's as useful to you as it has been to me. :)
